Purpose:
	The purpose of this project is to provide an easy way to activate a stepper motor from a variety of sources.
	This was done because the LUCSMACL has motion sensor lights hidden behind a wall, and we didn't want to get up.
	The project currently supports activation from a motion sensor and from a flask server that receives GET requests.

	The project logs each time it is activated. This should be modified in the future if the log begins to grow too large.
	Each time the motor is activated it should rotate 180 degrees clockwise and then 180 degrees counter clockwise.
