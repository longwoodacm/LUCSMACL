This provides an overview of how pc2 transforms the XSLT files
into HTML used by the ICPC Finals and Pacific Northwest Contest.

The scoreboard module looks 1st for xsl in ./data/xsl, if that directory
does not exist, it falls back to the data/xsl directory under the 
pc2 installation directory.

index.xsl
  Sample index as used at the ACM-ICPC Pacific Northwest Contest.
  Includes links to group?.html files
group1.xsl
groupN.xsl
  Sample per-group(region/site) files.  group1.xsl is for the
   1st group defined in PC^2.  Copy and replace the N with the
   additional groups (eg the 2nd group is 2 and would be in group2.xsl)

or
wf.index.xsl
   Like the summary.html, but with the ACM-ICPC World Finals ranking
   system.  Includes links to the group?.html files
wf.groupN.xsl
   Like the above groupN.xsl, except with ACM-ICPC World Finals
   ranking system.
wf.standings.xsl
   The end of the contest final standings with Honorable Mention and
   SuperRegion champions.

If wf.index.xsl is placed in the data/xsl directory, an html called
wf.index.html will be created by the scoreboard module.  Typically
if you are going to use the world finals ranking system you would
call this index.xsl/group.xsl (eg remove the "wf." part).
